1. INTRODUCTION

Scalereg is the registration system used by SCALE, the Southern
California Linux Expo. This registration software helped us run a
smooth show for over 1000 attendees during SCALE 6X and SCALE 7X. We
are releasing this code so other Open Source conferences can benefit
from it as well.

The SCALE Registration System (scalereg) is written in Python and uses
the Django framework.

You can find more about the projects mentioned above at their
respective websites:

2. REQUIREMENTS

To run Scalereg, you need the following:

- Django 0.96 [1] which in turn requires:
  - any Python version from 2.3 to 2.6 [2]
  - a database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, etc)
  
  
[1] We started writing Scalereg 2 years ago, before Django 1.0. We
    hope to update Scalereg to Django 1.0 soon. Post 0.96 Django
    releases have not been tested.
[2] Most testing has been with Python 2.4.

3. GETTING STARTED

After extracting the Scalereg tarball, from the top-level directory
of the Scalereg source (which contains this file), run the following
commands to start the project:

django-admin.py startproject scalereg
cp scalereg/settings.py scalereg/settings.py.bak
cp -a src/* scalereg

Now edit scalereg/settings.py and make sure all the settings look
correct. By default, we use a SQLite database since it requires
minimal setup. Please use the SECRET_KEY in scalereg/settings.py.bak,
and then delete scalereg/settings.py.bak. Also change the path in
TEMPLATE_DIRS with the full path to scalereg/scale_templates.  With
the application configured, run the following commands to initial the
database and start the webserver:

cd scalereg
python manage.py syncdb
python manage.py runserver 8080

Assuming all went smoothly, go to http://webserver:8080/admin to
configure the registration site, and http://webserver:8080/reg7
to try out the registration software.

If you want to integrate Scalereg with your web server software or
your database software, please see the Django website for more info.
